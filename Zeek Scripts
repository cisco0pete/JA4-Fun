This folder contains python scripts I have written to extract JA4+ fingerprints from:
  conn.log
  ssl.log
  http.log
All JA4 information is formatted into JSON and can be queried as such. This is similar to the JA4 implementation in Python3 offered by FoxIO. 
My scripts do not  do anything other than extract the JA4 information that has already been calculated by the JA4+ plugin with Zeek 7.0.8 itself. 
The UID or CONNECTION ID can be queried to see the JA4 hashes associated with that connection.
